==================
Releasing Numexpr
==================

Following are notes useful for releasing Numexpr.

Preliminaries
-------------

- Make sure that ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` and ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` are up to
  date with the latest news in the release.

- Check that ``release=True`` in ``numexpr/version.py``.

Testing
-------

- Run the test suite in different platforms (at least Linux and
  Windows) and make sure that all tests passes.

- Re-compile with MKL support and see if all tests passes as well.

- Run all the benchmarks in ``bench/`` directory and see if the
  speed-ups are the expected ones.

Packaging
---------

- Make the tarball with the command:

  $ python setup.py sdist

- Make the binary packages for supported Python versions (2.5 and 2.6
  currently).

Uploading
---------

- Go to the downloads section of the Numexpr project in Google Code
  and upload the source tarball and the binary packages.

- Upload it also in the PyPi repository.

  * First, register the new version with:
    $ python setup.py register

  * Then upload the files manually using the PyPI web interface.

Announcing
----------

- Send an announcement to the NumPy list and python-announce list.
  Use the ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` file as skeleton (or possibly as the
  definitive version).

Post-release actions
--------------------

Major/Minor versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Edit ``numexpr/version.py`` in trunk to increment the version to the
  next minor one (i.e. X.Y --> X.(Y+1)).  Set the `release` variable
  to False.

- Create a new branch for possible patch level revisions.  Call this
  branch just X.Y.

Patch level revisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Edit ``numexpr/version.py`` in trunk to increment the version to the
  next pach-level one (i.e. X.Y.Z --> X.Y.(Z+1)).  Set the `release`
  variable to False.

For all versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Create new headers for adding new features in ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt``
  and empty the release-specific information in ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` and
  add this place-holder instead:

  #XXX version-specific blurb XXX#


That's all folks!
