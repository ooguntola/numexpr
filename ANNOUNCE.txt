==========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.3.1
==========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

This is a maintenance release.  On it, support for the `unit32` type
has been added (it is internally upcasted to 'int64'), and a new
`abs()` function has been added (thanks to Pauli Virtanen for the
patch).

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:

or have a look at RELEASE_NOTES.txt in the tarball.

=========================

The project is hosted at Google code in:
