========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.1
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

This release is mainly intended to put in sync many of the
improvements that has the Numexpr version integrated in PyTables.
With this, the standalone version of Numexpr will benefit of this
well-proven version in production for more than a year now.  Also, the
documentation has been improved and tests can be run programatically.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, have a look at ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` in the tarball.
