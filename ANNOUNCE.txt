========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.2
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

- Support for Intel's VML (Vector Math Library) added, normally
  included in Intel's MKL (Math Kernel Library).  In addition, when
  the VML support is on, several processors can be used in parallel
  (see the new `set_vml_num_threads()` function).  With that, the
  computations of transcendental functions can be accelerated quite a
  few.  For example, typical speed-ups when using one single core for
  contiguous arrays are 3x with peaks of 7.5x (for the pow() function).
  When using 2 cores the speed-ups are around 4x and 14x respectively.
  Closes #9.

- Some new VML-related functions have been added:

  * set_vml_accuracy_mode(mode):  Set the accuracy for VML operations.

  * set_vml_num_threads(nthreads): Suggests a maximum number of
    threads to be used in VML operations.

  * get_vml_version():  Get the VML/MKL library version.

  See the README.txt for more info about them.

- In order to easily allow the detection of the MKL, the setup.py has
  been updated to use the numpy.distutils.  So, if you are already
  used to link NumPy/SciPy with MKL, then you will find that giving
  VML support to numexpr works almost the same.

- A new `print_versions()` function has been made available.  This
  allows to quickly print the versions on which numexpr is based on.
  Very handy for issue reporting purposes.

- The `numexpr.numexpr` compiler function has been renamed to
  `numexpr.NumExpr` in order to avoid name collisions with the name of
  the package (!).  This function is mainly for internal use, so you
  should not need to upgrade your existing numexpr scripts.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, have a look at ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` in the tarball.


Where I can find Numexpr?
