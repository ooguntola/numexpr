========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.2
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

# XXX Add blurb for the new release here

version, have a look at ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` in the tarball.
